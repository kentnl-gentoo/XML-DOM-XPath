==========================

# $Id: README,v 1.1.1.1 2003/12/04 20:40:43 mrodrigu Exp $

XML::DOM::XPath is a helper module for XML::DOM that adds XPath support to it.
It uses XML::XPath to resolve the XPath queries

In truth this should only be used if you have existing code using XML::DOM. 
If you start a new project and if you can install XML::LibXML (and libxml2 
on which it is based) then you will get a DOM, XPAth support and a lot more
power and speed.
